# Abstract

This assignment aims at providing the R code required for plotting 4 pre-defined plots. Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available in the script. The task is to reconstruct certain given plots, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.
